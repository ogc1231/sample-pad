# SAMPLE PAD

This is website/app is for a sample pad that play audio files based on user input, is had been developed for those interested in audio production. The user can activate audio files based on their direct input by clicking or pressing the corresponding keyboard key, more information on how use the app in the instruction of the webpage.

The aim was to build an interactive front-end website which is repsonsive to the users actions.

## UX
The design of the page of purposefully kept simple to make it has intuitive as possible for user to interact with website and to avoid distracting the user from the main purpose of the webpage. 

### Colour Scheme
I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/171717-ffffff-ff3939-777777-d3d3d3) to generate my colour palette.

![screenshot](https://github.com/ogc1231/sample-pad/blob/main/documentation/testing/coolors.png)

- `#171717` used for backgrounds and secondary text.
- `#ffffff` used for primary text.
- `#777777` used for primary highlights
- `#FF3939` used for secondary highlights and secondary text.
- `#D3D3D3` used for secondary highlights.

### Typography

Explain any fonts and icon libraries used, like Google Fonts and/or Font Awesome.

Consider adding a link to each font used, and the Font Awesome site if used (or similar icon library).

Example:

- [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) was used for the body text.

- [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato) was used for h1 and h2 text.

- [Remix Icon](https://remixicon.com/) icons were used for keyboard symbol on the pad buttons.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) icons were used for social media icons on the footer.

## Wireframes
I've used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes) to design my site wireframes.

### Home Page Wireframes
As the wireframe was created in the early stages of the project some things changed

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project,
and describe each in a sentence or so.

You will need to explain what value each of the features provides for the user,
focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve,
and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them.

IMPORTANT: Remember to always include a screenshot of each individual feature!
